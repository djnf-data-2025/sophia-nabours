Incarcerated individuals political opinions


By Sophia Nabours, scnabours@gmail.com, 501-593-0494, June 2, 2025

Examining the prison population’s political opinions during the 2024 election and exploring how both those who were barred and allowed to vote would have been reflected in polling data. How their collective political beliefs reveal about justice, disenfranchisement, overlooked elective narratives affected public opinion on prisoners’ potential voting choices. 
As conversations around criminal justice reform, detainee rights, and voting rights for incarcerated individuals gain traction ahead of the 2026 midterms, this piece will provide a timely lens into the political voices often most forgotten.
AUDIENCE: voters, researchers, formerly incarcerated and currently incarcerated individuals.
POSSIBLE SOURCES: 1) A data researcher from the Marshall Project that worked on the survey. 2) An incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individual willing to speak on political views in/outside prison. What is the political climate like in detainment? How were your political views affected by prison? 3) I’d love to look for a voting rights expert, someone informed on detained voting,

During the 2024 election, President Donald Trump reclaimed his position of power with 312 electoral college votes, beating the former Vice President Kamala Harris who received 226 electoral votes. Following the election, a large number of “what if” scenarios began to circulate. 

What if only white men had voted in the 2024 election? According to AP VoteCast 2024 general election data, Trump would have instead won by TKTK amount of votes, a TKTK increase from the general population. If only black men had voted the numbers would flip, displaying Harris polling in ahead of Trump by TKTK percentage points. 

However, the “what if” of the incarcerated population has remained untouched. Using the Marshall Project’s survey of the political stances of incarcerated individuals across the U.S., we can create a visualization of an often unrecognized voting population–actively detained prisoners and inmates. 

The Marshall project surveyed over 54,000 individuals in prisons and jails in 45 U.S. states on their choice for the presidential candidate of the 2024 general presidential election. 

Incarcerated population voting opinion polled in July of 2024 following the succession of Harris as the Democratic nominee:
